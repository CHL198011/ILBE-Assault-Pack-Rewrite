# ILBE Assault Pack - Rewrite

This mod is a rewrite of the ILBE Assault Pack (TFAR) mod made by Raspu.
With permission from Raspu I have rewritten several parts of the scripts and configs to make it fully working again.

__Major Changes__
* Removed ACE 3 dependency
* Compatibility with both TFAR 0.9.x and 1.0.x
* Fixed several issues with SATCOM

## Installation

Simply download the mod from the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1875281645), enable the mod in the Arma 3 Launcher under the "Mods" tab, and start playing!

## Requirements

### Required Mods
* [CBA](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=909547724)

### Optional Mods
* [ACE 3](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=909547724)

## Contents
* MARPAT Woodland, Desert, Coyote and Ranger Green camouflage
* 3 different antennas with different ranges (only for TFAR so far)
* Antennas can be interchanged with ACE Interaction system, or with Action Menu (scroll wheel) when ACE is not loaded.
* The different antennas give different ranges, and extending the Whip Antenna increases its range as well.
* Placeable RF-3080 sat antenna with ACE Interaction system, or with Action Menu (scroll wheel) when ACE is not loaded.
* If the player is near the RF-3080 antenna, the player has 4 times the TX/RX range (only for TFAR so far)
